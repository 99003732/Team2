## NOTE: If testing code manually in VSCode, when running calculator.exe, it will ask for "Enter pin". The default pin is "1234". Or, if you want to set your new pin, please delete the existing "PIN.txt" file inside "3_Implementation-> build" folder.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Issue in Making files- Solved by changing the path directory as I had made a earlier mistake while installing them. 
2. Making the header and .c files had some errors- Solved by trial and error methods and searching the net.
3. Reading and writing to permamnent memory, resolved by making a text file in local folder and saving the PIN to it.
4. Valgrind check issue - Solved by running the features individually.
5. Unity test issue - Solved by comparing and referring through given repository with our repository files.

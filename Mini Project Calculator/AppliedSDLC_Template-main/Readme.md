## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Issue in Making files- Solved by changing the path directory as I had made a earlier mistake while installing them. 
2. Making the header and .c files had some errors- Solved by trial and error methods and searching the net.
3. Reading and writing to permamnent memory, resolved by making a text file in local folder and saving the PIN to it
4. ...

## EPIC STATEMENT

|Funnel Entry  | 15/02/2021  |
|--|--|
| **Epic Name** | Genz_Calculator  |
|**Epic Owner**|Team 2 Takshashila|
|**Epic Description**|In the age of AI and one touch accessibility university students , researchers , scholars are stuck with the calculator designs from 90's Adding few convenient features for them is a least we can do for them , Adding a PIN functionality so that kids don't steal each others calculators , or to save researchers precious data , Flipping design makes our calculator more compact thus improving portability, auto parenthesis makes input speed lightning fast also reduces the headache of counting how many brackets to close unlike the calculators from famed brands who don't want to improve , we are ready for change. |
|**Business Outcomes**|A new hype for product in research communities, Colleges and various institutions, High demands for calculators from these communities|
|**Leading Indicators**|A calculator being stolen is a common in colleges and universities and finding it back is next to impossible. A lot of time is taken and a lot of mistakes are done in parenthesis intialisation and closing.|
|**Non-Function Requirements**|PIN should be Encrypted before saving in the internal memory so to prevent any jailbreak in system.
